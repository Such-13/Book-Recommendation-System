High-Level Design (HLD) Document

1. Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of the Book Recommender System, detailing its major components, architecture, and data flow. The system allows users to input a book title and receive a list of recommended books based on cosine similarity of combined textual features.

2. System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture with a web interface built using Flask (a Python web framework) and a machine learning backend for recommendations.

3. Major Components
Web Application: User interface for entering book titles and displaying recommendations.
Model Training Module: Preprocesses data and trains the machine learning model.
Recommendation Engine: Provides book recommendations based on user input.
Data Storage: Stores book data and pre-trained model files.

4. Data Flow
User enters a book title on the web application.
The input is sent to the Flask server.
The server uses the recommendation engine to generate a list of similar books.
Recommendations are sent back to the web application and displayed to the user.

5. Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS (for styling)
Backend: Python (Flask framework)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for cosine similarity), Pandas (for data handling)
Storage: CSV (for book data), Joblib (for model storage)
