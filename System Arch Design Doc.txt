Architecture Document
1. Overview
The architecture of the Book Recommender System follows a client-server model, utilizing a web interface for user interactions and a backend server to handle data processing and machine learning tasks.

2. System Architecture
The system is divided into several major components:

User Interface: A web-based UI built with HTML and CSS where users can input book titles and view recommendations.
Backend Server: A Flask application written in Python that handles HTTP requests, processes data, and interacts with the recommendation engine.
Recommendation Engine: A set of modules that preprocess data, train the machine learning model, and generate book recommendations.
Data Storage: A combination of CSV files for storing book data and Joblib files for storing the pre-trained machine learning model.
3. Major Components
3.1 User Interface
User Input Form: Allows users to input a book title.
Display Results: Shows the list of recommended books to the user.
3.2 Backend Server (Flask Application)
Data Loading Module: Responsible for loading the book dataset and the pre-trained model.
Routes: Handles the main routing for the web application.
Home Route (/): Displays the input form and handles the form submission.
3.3 Recommendation Engine
Model Training Module: Preprocesses the book data and trains the machine learning model.
Recommendation Module: Generates a list of recommended books based on the cosine similarity of combined textual features.
3.4 Data Storage
CSV File: Stores the book dataset.
Joblib File: Stores the pre-trained cosine similarity model.
4. Data Flow
User Input: The user enters a book title in the web application.
Form Submission: The input is sent to the Flask server via an HTTP POST request.
Processing: The server uses the recommendation engine to process the input and generate recommendations.
Response: The server sends the list of recommended books back to the web application.
Display: The web application displays the recommended books to the user.
5. Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Python (Flask framework)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for cosine similarity), Pandas (for data handling)
Storage: CSV (for book data), Joblib (for model storage)
Detailed Explanation of Components
1. User Interface (Web Application)
The user interface is a web page built with HTML and styled with CSS. It includes an input form where users can enter a book title and a section to display the recommended books.

2. Backend Server (Flask Application)
The Flask application handles the backend logic. It includes:

Routing: Manages the URL endpoints.
Data Loading: Loads the book dataset and pre-trained model from storage.
Recommendation Logic: Uses the recommendation engine to process user input and generate recommendations.
3. Recommendation Engine
The recommendation engine is responsible for:

Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the book data.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model using the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity.
Recommendation Generation: Generates recommendations based on cosine similarity scores.
4. Data Storage
The data storage component includes:

CSV File: Contains the book dataset.
Joblib File: Contains the pre-trained cosine similarity model.
